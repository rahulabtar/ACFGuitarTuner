Holds my work to implement various monophonic and polyphonic pitch detection algorithms in my own libraries to understand and use in future projects.
The goal is to gain a learning and understanding of these algorithms using python then implement them as C++ libraries to use on Microcontrollers 

Monophonic Pitch Detection:
ACF - Implemented in Python
AMSD - In progress
YIN - final goal

Implement these into a robust python file, and test with real time guitar input 

Polyphonic Pitch Detection: (planned)

RandomVertebrate's FFT harmonic analysis technique

Above implementing YIN for faster and more accurate results
